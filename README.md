This is a Node module for simple hashing and verifying inputs using the
Equihash proof-of-work algorithm as implemented by [ZCash](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v4.4.1). Most of the native code comes from or is adapted from [ZCash code](https://github.com/zcash/zcash). This module has been developed and tested on [Node v10.16.3](https://nodejs.org/) and
[Ubuntu 16.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/).

#### Need Support?

If you need help with a code-related matter, the first place to look is our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rNjez6VgNF), where the developers will be available to answer any questions. However, please do not come to me with issues regarding setup. Use Google and the existing documentation for that.
